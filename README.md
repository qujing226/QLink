# QLink
Quantum-Resistant Lattice-based Communication for DID

This project is derived from the following two repositories:
- [gochain](https://github.com/qujing226/go-chain)
- [easy-im](https://github.com/qujing226/easy-im)

However, a substantial portion of the original codebase has been modified, including:
- Core algorithm optimization (e.g., lattice-based key generation)  
- DID authentication protocol redesign  
- Communication module integration
