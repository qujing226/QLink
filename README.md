QLink
Quantum-Resistant Lattice-based Communication for DID

This project is derived from the following two repositories:

gochain
easy-im
However, a substantial portion of the original codebase has been modified, including:

Core algorithm optimization (e.g., lattice-based key generation)
DID authentication protocol redesign
Communication module integration
